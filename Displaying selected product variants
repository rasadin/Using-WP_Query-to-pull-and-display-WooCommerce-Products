And to finish off this article, hereâ€™s something very simple but still noteworthy; a method for displaying a particular productâ€™s variants:

$params = array(
        'posts_per_page' => 5,
        'post_type' => array('product_variation'),
        'post_parent' => 15
);




In this code we use the fact that product variants, as well as a post type variable, also set a field to the ID value of the parent-product. So in the above example we display up to 5 product variants that have an ID equal to 15; a great function if youâ€™ve got a lot of interesting variants to sell! Of course, as with all types of posts, we may add multiple parent-product IDs as an array to the parameter:



$params = array(
        'posts_per_page' => 5,
        'post_type' => array('product_variation'),
        'post_parent' => array(15, 25)
);
